# Settlement-Simulation-Game
   This is my first attempt at a game in Java. I did some research into how to create a basic game loop that included doing the calculations for the game logic as well as drawing the buildings onto the screen. I kept the game simple so as to avoid "feature creep", and because this is my first attempt at something like this I kept it small. The player can draw four different building types; Wall, Market, Home, and Farm. Each building type either adds to, or takes away from the players resource counter which can be seen at the top-right side of the game client.
   
   There is no win state or failure state. It is possible to play in such a way that you run out of resources and cannot
create any more buildings. In this instance, the settlements growth has become stunted and can no longer expand. However
the resources alloted for each building are generous and players are encouraged to have fun creating their settlement in
whatever fasion they'd like.

   If I return to the project in the future i'd like to increase the number of building types as well as add in-game
avatars to represent the number of people in the settlement.
